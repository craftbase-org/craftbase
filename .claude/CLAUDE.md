# Code style

- Use ES modules (import/export) syntax, not CommonJS (require)
- Destructure imports when possible (eg. import { foo } from 'bar')

# Code structure

- Please refer to ./CODEBASE_MAP.md file (at project's root) to understand code structure, key files, data flow, local state management using React Context and technology stack.

# Workflow

- Be sure to typecheck when you're done making a series of code changes
- Prefer running single tests, and not the whole test suite, for performance
